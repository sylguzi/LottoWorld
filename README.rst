==============

LottoAddict is a little program that simulates buying a lottery ticket and winning if you manage to match any numbers

Personas
========

Alex the avid lotto player
--------------

Alex has been parttaking in the lottery system ever since he was legally of age. Because of a new job, he's been 
playing more and more; he is realizing that he doesn't have enough cash to buy this favorite wine for dinner with his wife.

Details
^^^^^^^

Perhaps Alex has become too addicted to the random-ness of the lottery system, and needs to hold back a bit more.
Although statistically you win, those winnings rarely ever give enough to cover more lottery tickets.

Goals
^^^^^

Alex wants to find out if it's worth buying more tickets in one purchase, or if he should tone it down a bit so that he can 
afford romantic dinners with his wife over time. Perhaps a bungalo in the beaches won't come as quickly as he assumed.

Problem Scenarios
=================

"We expected to win at least once!"
-----------------------

At the end of the day, Alex seems to be spending a lot of money feeding his addiction to lottery tickets, when he could
be doing the same with something that won't take a toll on his family's wallet so quickly. The lottery tickets easily eat at
his wallet, and rarely ever give back enough. The occasional larger winning numbers don't ever seem to make up for
the money he lost, and his wife is becoming upset.

Current Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply buying less lottery tickets, but Alex's lottery addiction will become partched and that may end up 
taking a psychological toll on him as time passes by (withdrawls, much like with tobacco).

Value Proposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quick relief to feed the addiction without draining Alex's wallet to nothingness.

User Stories
============
------------

As Alex the avid lotto player, I want to relieve my lottery needs without spending as much money. The lotto program
will allow me to play lottery games quickly and efficently, and tell me how much I win after playing. It is also possible to
run dozens upon dozens of trials simultaneously, so single tickets do not have to be bought one at a time.

Acceptance Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scenario 1:
```````````````````````

::

    Given that I'm addicted to the randomness of lottery
        And I can't seem to be increasing my savings account 
        And I don't know my chances of winning, as they change every time,
    When I play this lottery game, I'll be able to see how often I can win
    Then play repeateldy if I don't believe it, simulate it dozens of times.
        And the statistics will set me free, if not I can simulate it again
        And choose my own numbers
        And save my money up once more.
